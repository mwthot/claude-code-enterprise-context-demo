# Development Workflow and Team Processes

## Branch Strategy

**GitFlow Model**: 
- `main` - production releases, protected branch requiring admin merge
- `develop` - integration branch for feature development
- `feature/*` - individual feature branches from develop
- `hotfix/*` - emergency production fixes from main

## Pull Request Process

**Required Reviews**: Minimum 2 approvals including 1 from service owner
**Automated Checks**: Unit tests (>80% coverage), integration tests, security scans, code quality gates
**PR Templates**: Structured format requiring feature description, testing approach, breaking changes documentation

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: JUnit 5 (Java), Jest (TypeScript), pytest (Python) - run on every commit
**Integration Tests**: Testcontainers for database testing, WireMock for external service mocking
**Contract Testing**: Spring Cloud Contract for API compatibility verification
**E2E Testing**: Playwright tests against staging environment before production deployment

## Code Quality Standards

**Static Analysis**: SonarQube for code quality, Snyk for vulnerability scanning
**Code Formatting**: Prettier (TypeScript), Spotless (Java), Black (Python) - enforced via pre-commit hooks
**Architecture Decision Records**: ADRs required for significant technical decisions

## Deployment Pipeline

**Environments**: local → dev → staging → production
**Database Migrations**: Flyway scripts with rollback validation, coordinated across services
**Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments with automated rollback on health check failures
**Feature Flags**: LaunchDarkly for gradual feature rollouts and quick rollbacks

## Incident Response

**On-Call Rotation**: 24/7 coverage with escalation procedures
**Runbooks**: Documented procedures for common incidents and service dependencies
**Post-Mortems**: Blameless retrospectives with action items tracked in Jira
**Status Pages**: Real-time system status with automated incident detection

## Development Environment

**Local Setup**: Docker Compose for service dependencies, VS Code with standardized extensions
**Cloud Development**: GitHub Codespaces for consistent development environments
**Database Access**: Read-only production replicas for debugging, anonymized data for development
