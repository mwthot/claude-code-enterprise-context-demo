# Service Dependencies and Integration Patterns

## Service Communication Matrix

| Service | User | Product | Order | Payment |
|---------|------|---------|-------|---------|
| **User** | - | Profile sync (async) | User validation (sync) | Account status (async) |
| **Product** | User preferences (async) | - | Inventory check (sync) | - |
| **Order** | User lookup (sync) | Product details (sync) | - | Payment processing (sync) |
| **Payment** | Account verification (sync) | - | Payment confirmation (async) | - |

## Integration Patterns

**Synchronous Communication (REST)**:
- User validation during order creation
- Product availability checks
- Payment authorization requests
- Data required for immediate business decisions

**Asynchronous Communication (Events)**:
- User profile updates → Product service for personalization
- Order status changes → User service for notifications  
- Payment confirmations → Order service for fulfillment
- Account status changes → cross-service coordination

## Event Schema

**User Events**:
```json
{
  "eventType": "UserProfileUpdated",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "changes": {"preferences": {...}}
}

**Order Events**: 
```json 
{
  "eventType": "OrderCreated", 
  "orderId": "uuid",
  "userId": "uuid",
  "items": [...],
  "totalAmount": "decimal"
}
```
## API Contracts
Authentication Headers: All requests include Authorization: Bearer <jwt> and X-Request-ID: <uuid>
Response Format: Standardized error responses with RFC 7807 Problem Details
Versioning: URL path versioning (/api/v1/) with backward compatibility requirements
Rate Limiting: 1000 requests/minute per user, 10000/minute per service

## Circuit Breaker Configuration

### User Service Dependencies:

External identity provider: 5 failures → 30s circuit open
Database: 3 failures → 10s circuit open
Redis cache: 10 failures → 5s circuit open (graceful degradation)

### Fallback Strategies:

User service down → cached user data with 5-minute TTL
Product service down → basic product info without recommendations
Payment service down → save for later functionality

## Data Consistency Patterns
Eventual Consistency: User preferences → product recommendations (acceptable delay: 5 minutes)
Strong Consistency: Payment processing → order confirmation (immediate requirement)
Compensating Transactions: Failed payment → order cancellation with inventory restoration


## Monitoring and Observability
Health Checks: /health endpoint with dependency status, 30-second intervals
Distributed Tracing: Request correlation IDs across service boundaries
Business Metrics: Order completion rate, payment success rate, user engagement metrics
SLA Targets: 99.9% uptime, <200ms response time, <0.1% error rate
