# E-Commerce Platform Architecture Overview

## System Design Principles

**Microservices Architecture**: Four independent services (User, Product, Order, Payment) with clear domain boundaries and independent deployment capabilities.

**Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous messaging via RabbitMQ for eventual consistency, synchronous REST APIs for immediate consistency requirements.

**API Gateway Pattern**: Kong provides rate limiting, authentication, request routing, and protocol translation between external clients and internal services.

## Service Boundaries

- **User Service**: Account management, authentication, profile data, preferences
- **Product Service**: Catalog management, inventory tracking, pricing, search
- **Order Service**: Order lifecycle, cart management, fulfillment coordination  
- **Payment Service**: Payment processing, transaction history, refund handling

## Data Architecture

**Database Per Service**: Each service owns its data schema and access patterns. PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for caching and session storage.

**Event Sourcing**: Order service maintains event log for auditability and replay capabilities.

**CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write models in Product service for search optimization.

## Infrastructure Decisions

**Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes with Helm charts for application deployment
**Service Mesh**: Istio for traffic management, security, and observability
**CI/CD**: GitOps with ArgoCD for automated deployments
**Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, Jaeger for distributed tracing

## Security Architecture

**Zero Trust Network**: All service communication encrypted with mTLS
**JWT Authentication**: Stateless tokens with 15-minute expiry, refresh token rotation
**RBAC Authorization**: Role-based access control at API gateway and service levels
**Data Protection**: Encryption at rest (AES-256), PII tokenization, audit logging

## Scalability Patterns

**Horizontal Scaling**: Services auto-scale based on CPU/memory metrics
**Database Scaling**: Read replicas for query distribution, connection pooling
**Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (Redis, CDN, application-level)
**Load Balancing**: Round-robin with health checks, circuit breaker pattern
